Appendix D: ReadMe Document for next year’s group
How to Run Sub
1.	Upload TestComms.ino onto the Arduino
2.	Seal Sub and connect tether
3.	SSH into the Sub using the tether
4.	Switch on Arduino using the Switch on the Front of the Sub
5.	Run ControlsSubv3.py using python ControlsSubv3.py  (make sure to cd to correct directory which is PythonTest)
6.	Should prompt user for certain inputs (Delta – update rate, Depth – in meters, Yaw – in degrees from starting point, X and Y in meters (these need to be fixed before using, can be commented out in Python Code).
7.	Sub will run for approximately 30 seconds and prompt for new commands
8.	To store data, use the csv storage in the main loop

Common Problems 
Code runs but sub doesn’t move:
1.	Check that the Arduino is powered by the switch on front of sub
2.	Check that the Depth sensor is initializing in the Arduino code
2a.  Check all wire connections between sensor and Arduino
2b.  Make sure the logic conversion board between sensor and Arduino is functioning properly
2c.  Check that the Arduino and NUC are communicating correctly

Can't SSH into sub
1.	Check tether connection and wires (we had issues with the tether and had to re-solder some wires)
3.	Password for NUC is Rob0sub!
Camera control
1.	Open MATLAB
2.	The file CameraCode.m should be in the working directory on the left
1.	Open the file
2.	Click Run
Note: make sure the videoinput is ‘linuxvideo’ on the sub or you’ll get an error.
